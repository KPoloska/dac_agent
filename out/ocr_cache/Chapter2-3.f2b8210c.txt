2. Authorization Governance

2 Authorization Governance

Authorization is a central part of the IAM processes once the user has been authenticated. Users are
granted authorizations according to their role at an organization (“role-based access control”
(RBAC)). Authorizations determine a role’s resources and level of access to the IT Asset.

Please describe how authorization of authenticated users is managed in the table below.

Note: Only user access types should be mentioned here. No external users are required. Only
internal users (= internal and external employees, which are managed by HR).

* The term “authorization” refers to the procedure of granting access to the IT Asset’s data or functions during run-
time. Not to be mixed with Access Governance topics, e.g. request of role-based access, user recertification, etc.
