Introduction

Introduction

Welcome to the digital authorization concept of the application MICROSOFT OFFICE
365 (AID551)!

The authorization concept is a systematic approach to managing and controlling access rights and
authorizations within an IT system or organization. Its primary objective is to ensure that only
authorized individuals can access specific data, applications, or resources, thereby safeguarding
the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. All pertinent information should be
documented centrally to meet regulatory requirements.

The current authorization concept template comprises the following chapters: General
Information, IT Asset Description, Authorization Governance, Access Governance, Authorization
Objects, Entitlements, IT Roles, Account Management, Segregation of Duties, References, and List
of Abbreviations. Each chapter is briefly outlined below:

General Information

The General Information chapter includes the Introduction (this page) and Change History. This
chapter outlines the basics of the authorization concept and the structure of the document. The
Change History section logs versions of the document, detailing the author, date, and comments. A
new version is created automatically when the authorization concept successfully passes the
approval process.

IT Asset Description

This chapter documents general information about the IT asset, including master data about the
application, the environment landscape, and the infrastructure components in use.

Authorization Governance
This chapter describes the implementation of authorization and authentication.

Access Governance

The Access Governance chapter details the entire process of assigning access to the application.
